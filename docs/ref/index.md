# Reference 
Link to your [docs.rs page](https://docs.rs/binnev-rust-template) here.

It is possible to put your docstrings in markdown files (like `add.md`, `multiply.md`, etc) and attach them to the code object they describe (see `lib.rs`). This allows you to have some kind of API reference in the mkdocs site, but it does make the code less readable.
