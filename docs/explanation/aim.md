# Aim of the Project
Setting up a new project can be time-consuming. As a result, people often copy-paste configuration from an existing project, including all the mistakes and outdated tools. 

This project serves as a cookie cutter template for starting new Rust projects. It is designed to incorporate the most up-to-date tools and best practices, enabling developers to quickly set up a robust and modern Rust development environment.
